[{"content":"Introduction Automation of non-destructive evaluation (NDE) processes has typically relied on rudimentary tools that support a trained operator manually interpreting data. The abundance of data and implementation of Internet of Things and Industry 4.0 provide a new exciting opportunity to extract more accurate information in a more efficient manner - hence, enabling automation. A general framework for the automation in ultrasonic NDE enabled by deep learning is provided below.\nAutomation levels for ultrasonic NDE [1].\rThis research line explores data science and artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques for the automation of NDE processes, including data pre-processing, defect detection, and defect or material characterisation.\nData pre-processing NDE data are typically noisy and contain elements that may obscure defective information. In the case of ultrasonic NDE, this can be realised in the form of artefacts - benign feature that appear in images (ultrasonic imaging) potentially obscuring defects. I have addressed this problem from a data-driven perspective, i.e. using datasets to build a model that can suppress the artefacts, ideally in the time-domain, before going to the image domain (as in the latter, preserving information from a pixel area is much more difficult).\nTo tackle this issue, I have proposed two methods [2,3] based on the concepts of autoencoders and PCA, which use either numerical or experimental data in order to learn the artefact representation in the time domain and suppress them. In [2], the suppression was addressed by blanking out some parts of the ultrasonic signals, while in [3] a subtraction was proposed. The benefit of [2] is an enhanced removal of artefacts but at the cost of removing defect-related energy and distorting the spread function. In [3], these limitations where addressed, showing a more realistic spread function of the defects while having a very limited impact in the level of artefact suppression.\nArtefact suppression example (Figure taken from [3]). First column is the raw image without suppression, second column is the PCA-AE from [3] compared against the GB-AE autoencoder in [2] and the original defect.\rThe overall limitations rely on the simplistic inspection configuration considering flat specimens and artefacts stemming from back- and front-walls. These are aspects that are considered to have an implication in the design of the data-driven models, and that are under research consideration.\nDefect detection This NDE stage involves the binary classification of a set of data in either defective or pristine material. In ultrasonic imaging, this is typically done by setting a threshold value (based on defect-free data) and identifying any amplitude above the threshold. The approaches from data pre-processing can be seen as an attempt to improve the performance of classical detectors.\nDeep learning offers the possibility to detect defects from images by visually inspecting an image and tracing boxes whereby a defect is believed to be seen (e.g. through CNNs). Binary classifiers can also be created to provide information about the defect information in a piece of NDE data. However, the main issue with these approaches is the reliance on defect data, which are usually scarce in nature in NDE. Alternatives could include unsupervised approaches for anomaly detection, which effectively bypass the need for defective data and issues about class imbalance.\nDefect/Material characterisation Characterising defects or material properties involves the prediction of numerical variables - e.g. defect size or remaining wall thickness. In ultrasonic imaging, this has been typically addressed through clipping methods (e.g. -6dB method) with the hope that it would help determine an accurate estimate of the defect size. However, these methods are conservative and not very accurate.\nNeural networks provide an excellent alternative that produces numerical predictions from complex, structured or unstructured data. For example, predicting crack length and orientation from half-skip ultrasonic images [4] or estimating minimum wall thickness in heavily corroded materials [5]. Comparing against traditional methods to do this, the data-driven approaches easily improves their accuracy.\nCNN architecture for wall thickness prediction [5].\rHowever, issues w.r.t. the training data, uncertainty quantification and domain adaptation (when numerical data is required to train but the model is applied in experimental data) are still being explored to further improve these models. More remarkably, explainable AI can provide very useful information to determine the right network architecture to improve these models.\nResearch work The work in this area is nowadays focused on explanability and how that can help inform about (1) the behaviour of deep learning models for specific applications and (2) the optimal model structure through a human-interpretable and reasoned approach without having to do trial and errors. Further improvements in the artefact suppression and new ways of addressing the detection (and its performance evaluation through e.g. ROC curves) are also under consideration.\nReferences Cantero-Chinchilla, S., Wilcox, P.D. and Croxford, A.J., 2022.

This is even more evident in the case of safety-critical applications, where conservatism and probabilistic measurements are necessary.\nIn the area of Non-Destructive Evaluation (NDE), inspection qualification requires a full in-depth analysis of the methods involved, even if they are digital. When talking about deep learning and NDE, this is very important as deep learning typically acts as an opaque box model that makes it difficult to interpret. At least, a measure of the uncertainties would be required.\nResearch work The work carried out in this area is nowadays focused on rigorously characterising the uncertainty related to the deep learning model (AKA epistemic uncertainty). This is being done through deep ensembles as it is the most rigorous technique to estimate epistemic uncertainty. Next steps will involve the comparison with other, more efficient, techniques for uncertainty quantification such as Flipout, Bayesian networks, among others.\nThis work is being partially funded by the UK Research Centre for Non-Destructive Evaluation.\n","permalink":"https://scanteroch.github.io/research/uq_dl/","summary":"Introduction Deep learning methods can be highly accurate and efficient, but that comes at a cost.

Similarly, classical arrays need to find alternative coupling approaches when the geometry of the inspected specimen is irregular. Laser-induced phased-arrays (LIPAs) overcome these issues as it is a non-contact NDT technique that enable ultrasonic imaging in a similar fashion as classical phased-arrays [1].\nExperimental setup of LIPA inspections [2].\rThe main limitation currently is the acquisition time, which is highly dependent on hardware and is done sequentially for one detection and generation point at a time. In a full matrix capture, this configuration impacts significantly the efficiency of the method. Therefore, finding optimal configurations that minimise the measurement points is essential, and that is the main objective of this research line.\nResearch work The work addressed in this research area has focused on optimising the configuration of LIPAs for 1D inspections. This is based on the detection performance (trough ROC curves and SNR as proxy) of multiple candidate configurations (i.e. physical and computational aperture in addition to pitch). The developed methods in [2] consider the continuous case when inspecting large parts, specifically whereby the number of measurement points start to increase dramatically with the inspected distance (see figure below). The optimised array configurations can also be tailored depending on the type of target defect and size that needs to be inspected.\nInspection configuration for 1D LIPA inspections [2].\rNowadays, the problem is being explored from 1D to 2D in order to enable inspections of large areas. This requires a step up in the theory and implementation so that 2D arrays can be optimised when considering continuous inspections.\nThis work is part of the ALIPA project primarily funded by the UK EPSRC.\nReferences Stratoudaki, T., Clark, M. and Wilcox, P.D., 2016.

In particular, I am interested in incorporating uncertainty quantification along the way to obtain the most robust locations that can manage some level of noise. This problem not only need to provide the most informative locations but also the optimal number of sensors, which introduces an economic problem such that when adding more sensors, more hardware, software and data management costs are added. Although the methods that I have developed are quite generic and applicable to many other domains, I have worked on guided-wave based structural health monitoring (SHM). Therefore, the sensors that are optimised are of the form of PZT discs.\nApproaches Value of information The first alternative approach that I have developed is based on the value of information [1,2]. The value of information gives a mathematically rigorous tool to compare different sensor configurations (including location and number of sensors) and determine the value of implementing the candidate configurations. The cost/benefit is defined here as a hybrid between the amount of information (through the distance of two probability density functions) that is acquired by a configuration along with the cost of adding the sensors.\nThe problem can account for uncertainties stemming from identifiable parameters (e.g. coordinates of the damage) and nuisance parameters that do not need to be identified (e.g. wave speed velocity). By exploring the effect of different parameters and optimisation algorithms in the output, one can be confident in the results that the method provides, which are explainable and mathematically consistent.\nComparison of three sensor layouts (optimal and suboptimal) along with their reconstruction results [1].\rInformation entropy The second approach that I developed was based on the information entropy [3]. This method relies on several hypotheses and simplifications that make the problem able to be solved analytically by standard minimisation algorithms in Matlab or Python. The key assumption is the relaxation of binary variables considered for the location (either a sensor is or is not \u0026ldquo;activated\u0026rdquo;), which makes the optimisation problem and the objective function convex.\nThis contribution enables a strong reduction in computational time as everything (location and number) can be solved at once. This method is flexible and can be adapted and implemented in different platforms relatively easily. A base code is provided both in MATLAB and Python [4] to optimise PZT for damage localisation in metallic and composite plates. This is to evaluate the performance and adapt it and extend it to other applications.\nOptimal configuration of sensors and actuators in a composite plate [3].\rResearch work Research work in this area will look at different problems (ultrasonic NDE, eddy currents, etc.). In addition, for the information entropy, the estimation of the entropy without many of the assumptions involve expensive calculations of probabilistic evidences. However, a more accurate estimate of the entropy could be obtained in this manner. Efficient avenues to obtain these quantities will also be explored.\nReferences Cantero‐Chinchilla, S., Papadimitriou, C., Chiachío, J., Chiachío, M., Koumoutsakos, P., Fabro, A.T. and Chronopoulos, D., 2022.
