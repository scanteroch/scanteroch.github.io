## Vision
My vision is to develop digital and data-driven technologies that enable more efficient, more informative, and safer engineering operations. This ranges from the design stages of engineering assets or products until its decomissioning, including their maintenance.

## List of research topics
Below you will find a series of posts with the main topics that I have or am currently involved with. This is not an exhaustive list, but if you spot something that is interesting to you and would like to initiate a collaboration, please [contact](/about) with me.
